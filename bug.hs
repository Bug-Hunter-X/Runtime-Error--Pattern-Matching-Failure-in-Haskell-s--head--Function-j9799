```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  let ys = sort xs
  print ys
  print $ head ys
```
This code will compile and run without any errors, but it is prone to a runtime error if the input list `xs` is empty.  `head ys` will throw an exception if `ys` is empty, because there is no first element to retrieve.
