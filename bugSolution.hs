```haskell
import Data.List (sort)
import Data.Maybe (fromMaybe)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let xs = []  --Example empty list
  let ys = sort xs
  let maybeHead = listToMaybe ys
  let safeHead = fromMaybe 0 maybeHead --Provide a default value
  print ys
  print safeHead

--Helper function to safely get the head of a list
listToMaybe :: [a] -> Maybe a
listToMaybe [] = Nothing
listToMaybe (x:_) = Just x
```
This improved version uses pattern matching and `Data.Maybe`'s `listToMaybe` to safely handle the case where the input list is empty.  It provides a default value (0 in this example) if the list is empty, preventing a runtime error.  The example shows handling empty list scenarios by providing a default value using `fromMaybe`.
